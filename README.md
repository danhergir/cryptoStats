# Overview

This is an app created in React Native for iOS and Android phones to visualize the prices of cryptocurrencies

The app gives you the possibility to watch the changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies and explore new ones

The purpose of this project was to develop an app for Android and iOS with the same codebase, and it could be possible thanks to the power of React Native, also it's a demonstration of my programming skills.
